# Enable or disable Press Enter to send

By default, Zulip sends your message when you press `ENTER` (or
`RETURN`) on your keyboard.

If you want to disable this feature, simply uncheck the **Press Enter to send**
option in the bottom right corner of the compose box. Upon doing so, you
will see a **Send** button in the bottom right corner of the compose box.

When the **Press Enter to send** feature is disabled, pressing the
Enter key will no longer send your message, and you will have to click the
**Send** button to send your message.

If youâ€™d like to re-enable the **Press Enter to send** feature, just check
the **Press Enter to send** box again, and you will be able to send
your messages by pressing the Enter key.
